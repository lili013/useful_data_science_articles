# useful_data_science_articles

This is a small repository for organizing different articles, notes, blog post or online class notes in the form of Github's Issues.

This idea is inspired by one of [Khuyen Tran's post](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-organize-your-data-science-articles-with-github-b5b9427dad37).
